        <p>
          As a third year computer science student, I have an interest in
          programming and am committed to creating projects that enhance
          people's lives and my own skills. My passion for developer piqued my
          interest. And I am looking for a job that is consistent with my
          knowledge and abilities. My goal is to gain valuable experience and
          grow professionally in this field.
